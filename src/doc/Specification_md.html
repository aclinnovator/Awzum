<p>=begin</p>

<p>This is the lexer for Awzum, the new name that I am giving to the language
from the book, called Awesome. I intend to write my own code and then check
it with the book so I am not just copying and pasting, but actually
actively writing a language while being guided by the book. Awzum language
is not going to be production ready because of the timeframe of its
production and the amount of time I have to spend designing a production
ready language, although I believe that if I had enough time, I would be
able to create a production ready language, perhaps even with writing my
own lexer and parser. I just have this feeling that I will eventually
persevere. To create a production ready language, would need to follow the
right design patterns and make optimizations, and all the stuff that comes
when you make a real language. This is NOT a real production ready language
and will just be me finding my way as I follow the book. So here is the
lexer.</p>

<p>Some notes on the parser: I would use my own parsing framework and not Racc
a suggested by the book just for the sake of doing things differently,
which is what usually do, but because my summer is contingent on me getting
things right in a certain timeframe, I dont want to deviate from the path
and perhaps run into unexpected problems due the books dependency on a
certain lexer. This might change though as I get more comfortable writing
my own language. For now, I am going to build using the book&#39;s lexer
and Racc(which is what I think the book uses. I haven&#39;t gotten to it
though).</p>

<p>So wish me luck.</p>
